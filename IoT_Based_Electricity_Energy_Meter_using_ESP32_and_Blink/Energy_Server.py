Project: IoT-Based Smart Energy Monitoring System (Cloud Server)

Summary:
This script runs on a cloud server to manage MQTT data from the ESP32, store it in an SQLite database, and predict energy usage patterns using a simple linear regression model. It subscribes to the 'energy/data' topic, processes incoming JSON messages, and stores voltage, current, and power data. The ML model predicts future power consumption based on historical data. The script integrates with a web dashboard for real-time visualization.

Implementation Details:
1. Software Setup:
   - Installed Python 3.9+, paho-mqtt, scikit-learn, sqlite3, and pandas on the server.
   - Set up a Mosquitto MQTT broker (e.g., on AWS EC2 or local machine).
   - Configured Mosquitto with anonymous access for simplicity (add TLS/username for security in production).
   - Created an SQLite database 'energy_data.db' for storing sensor data.

2. MQTT Subscription:
   - Subscribed to 'energy/data' topic to receive ESP32 data.
   - Parsed JSON messages containing voltage, current, and power.
   - Stored data in SQLite with timestamps.

3. Machine Learning:
   - Used scikit-learn's LinearRegression to predict power consumption based on historical data.
   - Trained the model on power and timestamp data (simplified; real systems may use more features).
   - Saved predictions to the database for dashboard access.

4. Testing and Deployment:
   - Tested MQTT connectivity using a tool like MQTT Explorer.
   - Verified database storage and ML predictions via logs.
   - Deployed on AWS EC2 or a local server with Mosquitto running.
   - Ensured port 1883 is open for MQTT communication.

5. Optimization:
   - Optimized database queries for fast dashboard updates.
   - Scheduled periodic ML model retraining (e.g., daily).
   - Added logging for debugging and monitoring.

Note: This script assumes a local or cloud Mosquitto broker. For production, secure MQTT with TLS and authentication. The ML model is simplified; consider LSTM or ARIMA for advanced predictions.
