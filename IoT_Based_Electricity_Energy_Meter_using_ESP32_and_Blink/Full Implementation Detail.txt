Full Explanation and Implementation Steps
The comment blocks in each code file provide detailed implementation instructions, but hereâ€™s a consolidated overview to ensure clarity:

Hardware Setup:
Components: ESP32 DevKitC, INA219 sensor, household appliance (e.g., 60W lamp), 5V power supply.
Connections: Connect INA219 to ESP32 I2C pins (SDA: GPIO 21, SCL: GPIO 22, VCC: 3.3V, GND: GND). Wire INA219 in series with the appliance (load between VIN+ and VIN-).
Safety: Ensure proper insulation and compliance with electrical safety standards. Use a low-power appliance for initial testing.
ESP32 Firmware Setup:
Install Arduino IDE and add ESP32 board support via Boards Manager (https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json).
Install libraries: Adafruit_INA219, WiFi, PubSubClient via Library Manager.
Update Energy_Monitor.ino with your WiFi credentials and MQTT broker address (e.g., broker.mqtt.com or a local Mosquitto server).
Upload the code to the ESP32 using a USB cable.
Cloud Server Setup:
MQTT Broker: Install Mosquitto on a server (e.g., AWS EC2, Raspberry Pi, or local PC) using sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients (Ubuntu). Configure mosquitto.conf for anonymous access or add TLS/username for security.
Python Environment: Install Python 3.9+, paho-mqtt, scikit-learn, pandas, sqlite3, flask, flask-cors using pip install.
Run Energy_Server.py to handle MQTT data and ML predictions.
Run Energy_API.py to serve data to the dashboard. Ensure both scripts access the same energy_data.db.
Web Dashboard Setup:
Install Node.js and npm.
Create a React project: npx create-react-app energy-dashboard.
Replace public/index.html with the provided index.html.
Install dependencies: npm install mqtt chart.js react-chartjs-2.
Add Tailwind CSS: Follow instructions at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app.
Update the MQTT broker URL (ws://broker.mqtt.com:9001) and API URL (http://your-server:5000/history) in index.html.
Run locally: npm start. Deploy to a server using npm run build and Nginx.
Testing and Calibration:
ESP32: Verify sensor readings via Serial Monitor (115200 baud). Test with a known load (e.g., 60W bulb) and check MQTT messages with MQTT Explorer.
Cloud Server: Confirm data storage in energy_data.db and ML predictions via logs. Test API with curl http://your-server:5000/history.
Dashboard: Ensure real-time updates and chart rendering. Verify historical data plots correctly.
Calibrate INA219 using library tools if readings are inaccurate.
Deployment and Optimization:
Deploy the ESP32 in a household, monitoring a single appliance.
Host the server and dashboard on AWS EC2 or a local machine with public access.
Optimize ESP32 power consumption with deep sleep (add esp_deep_sleep_start() after publishing).
Retrain the ML model periodically with new data for better predictions.
Secure MQTT and API with TLS and authentication for production.
Documentation for Website:
Create a GitHub repository with all code files, a README, and a block diagram (use Lucidchart or Draw.io).
Record a demo video showing the ESP32 setup, real-time dashboard updates, and ML predictions (use OBS Studio).
Host the dashboard on a public URL (e.g., AWS Amplify) and link it on your website.
Notes
Scalability: The system monitors one appliance for simplicity. Extend it to multiple appliances by adding more INA219 sensors and unique MQTT topics [].mdpi.com
ML Model: The linear regression model is basic. For advanced predictions, consider LSTM or ARIMA, requiring more historical data and computational resources [].matellio.com
Security: Use MQTT TLS and API authentication in production to protect data [].how2electronics.com
Compliance: Ensure electrical safety when connecting to household appliances.
