Home: "From Village Roots to Global Innovation" - A teaser of my journey from Nigeria to international stages.

Goal: Chukwunalu's goal is to distinguish himself among peers through his knowledge in a specific area of research especially in hardware security, cybersecurity, formal verification and quantum computing. 

My Story: Growing up selling onions with his mother in a village market, Chukwunalu turned late-night studies and a deep hunger for knowledge into academic success. From winning a community scholarship to completing a degree in Electrical Engineering, his journey has been shaped by resilience and a passion for technology. Determined to chart a different path, he transformed late-night study sessions into academic triumphs, earning community scholarships and distinguishing himself as a beacon of hope for his family. His story reflects an unwavering commitment to education, innovation, and uplifting others‚Äîa commitment that continues to define his career and community work. Today, he is committed to using his skills to make a global impact in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and education.


Education & Research: Chukwunalu is currently pursuing an MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Dakota State University (expected Spring 2026). His current research is in Hardware Security and Formal Verification specifically Hardware Trojans in Asynchronous Pre Charge Half Buffers (PCHB). He also, has condcuted research in Formal Property-Based Verification of LSQ-LFENCE for Memory Ordering and Security Assurance, tackling speculative execution vulnerabilities in modern processors. He was honored as a 2025 P.O. Pistilli DAC Ambassador Award winner for creating a Wikipedia article on Design Automation for Quantum Circuits and presented at the prestigious DAC 2025 conference in San Francisco, establishing himself as a rising voice in hardware security and high-performance computing.



Professional Journey: He has led cybersecurity teams at Barclays UK, Amazon UK and Zenith Bank Plc, implementing cutting-edge solutions to protect global financial systems. From deploying advanced penetration and monitoring tools to designing Raspberry Pi-based battery monitoring systems for USDA bee habitat networks, his professional path bridges industry expertise with innovative engineering solutions.



Community Impact: At Barclays UK, Chukwunalu volunteered with the Teardrops Initiative, supporting a charity organization by serving warm meals, cleaning the environment, and transforming spaces into havens for homeless individuals. He found profound fulfilment in every small act of kindness, driven by his belief in the power of compassion to restore dignity and hope.

Having lost his mother to cancer, he has since dedicated his life to educating and supporting women on breast cancer awareness through the sponsorship of the Joyful Tears Initiative in Nigeria. His community outreach extends to youth development as well; during his National Youth Service Corps in 2017, he passionately educated young people on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, inspiring them to take action toward a more equitable and sustainable future.

Most recently, during Fall 2025, Chukwunalu volunteered at North Dakota State University to assist with onboarding and freshmen registration. He provided guidance and support to new students, ensuring they felt welcomed and empowered as they embarked on their academic journey.
