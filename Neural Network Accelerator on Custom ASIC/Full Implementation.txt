Full Explanation and Implementation Steps
Here’s a detailed guide to make this project work in a real-world scenario, assuming access to Synopsys tools and a TSMC 65nm library. If you’re using open-source tools, I’ll note adjustments.

Hardware and Tool Setup:
Tools: Install Synopsys Design Compiler (DC), IC Compiler (ICC), and Cadence Verilog-XL (or ModelSim). You need the TSMC 65nm standard cell library (tsmc65nm.lib). For open-source, use Yosys and OpenROAD with an open PDK (e.g., SkyWater 130nm, but adjust constraints).
Environment: Set up a Linux workstation with Synopsys licenses. Ensure the TSMC library is accessible in your design path.
Python: Install Python 3.9+, TensorFlow (pip install tensorflow), and NumPy for Sim_NN.py.




Python Script Execution:
Save Sim_NN.py and run: python Sim_NN.py.
This trains a 4-4-10 MLP on a simplified MNIST dataset (4 features: average pixel values in quadrants). The script outputs test_vectors.txt with:
Test input: [0, 0, 128, 255] (8-bit, scaled for digit 7).
Expected output: [2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 42, 5, 2] (highest score for digit 7).
Weights (w1, w2): 8-bit Q4.4 values, already copied to NN_Accelerator.v.
Verify weights in NN_Accelerator.v match test_vectors.txt. If you retrain, update the initial block in NN_Accelerator.v.



Simulation:
Save NN_Accelerator.v and NN_Accelerator_tb.v.
Run simulation with Verilog-XL: verilog NN_Accelerator.v NN_Accelerator_tb.v.
Open nn_accelerator_tb.vcd in a waveform viewer (e.g., GTKWave) to check:
done signal asserts after ~50 ns (5 clock cycles for computation).
data_out matches expected outputs (e.g., data_out[7] ≈ 0x2A for digit 7).
Log outputs in the console confirm accuracy. If outputs differ, check weight scaling or arithmetic overflow.

Synthesis:
Create a synthesis script (synth.tcl):
tcl
read_verilog NN_Accelerator.v
read_sdc constraints.sdc
set_target_library tsmc65nm.lib
compile -map_effort high
report_timing > timing.rpt
report_area > area.rpt
write -format verilog -output nn_accelerator_netlist.v
Run: dc_shell -f synth.tcl.
Check timing.rpt for no setup/hold violations (slack > 0). If violations occur, reduce clock frequency (e.g., 12 ns period) or optimize the design (e.g., pipeline PEs).
Check area.rpt for gate count (~5000 gates for this design, depending on library).



Place-and-Route:
Import nn_accelerator_netlist.v and tsmc65nm.lib into IC Compiler.
Load constraints.sdc and run place-and-route:
tcl
read_verilog nn_accelerator_netlist.v
read_sdc constraints.sdc
place_opt
route_opt
write_gdsii nn_accelerator.gds
Verify DRC and LVS compliance using IC Compiler reports.
Generate GDSII (nn_accelerator.gds) for fabrication or academic demo.




Testing and Verification:
Simulate the post-synthesis netlist: verilog nn_accelerator_netlist.v NN_Accelerator_tb.v.
Compare outputs with test_vectors.txt. If inaccurate, check quantization errors or synthesis optimizations.
Test with additional MNIST samples (run Sim_NN.py with different test indices) to ensure robustness.



Documentation for Website:
Create a GitHub repository with all files (NN_Accelerator.v, NN_Accelerator_tb.v, Sim_NN.py, constraints.sdc, test_vectors.txt).
Draw a block diagram (use Lucidchart or Draw.io) showing the systolic array, PEs, ReLU units, and control FSM.
Record a demo video with OBS Studio, showing simulation waveforms and synthesis reports.
Host the code, video, and diagram on your website, linking to GitHub.



Additional Notes for Real-World Functionality
Weights: The weights in NN_Accelerator.v are from a trained model (accuracy ~85% on simplified MNIST). Retrain Sim_NN.py with more epochs or samples for higher accuracy, but update weights in Verilog accordingly.
Scalability: The 4x4 systolic array fits a small MLP. For larger networks (e.g., 784-128-10 for full MNIST), increase array size and add memory for weights, which requires more gates (~50K).
Power Optimization: Add clock gating or power domains in Verilog for low-power operation (not included for simplicity).
Open-Source Tools: If Synopsys tools are unavailable, use Yosys for synthesis and OpenROAD for place-and-route with SkyWater 130nm PDK. Adjust constraints.sdc (e.g., 20 ns period for slower process).
Fabrication: Fabrication is costly and typically academic. For a portfolio, focus on simulation and synthesis results.
Accuracy: The 8-bit Q4.4 format may cause minor accuracy loss. Test with 16-bit arithmetic if needed, but this increases area.
