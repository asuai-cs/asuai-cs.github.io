Full Explanation and Implementation Steps
The comment blocks in each code file provide detailed instructions, but here’s a consolidated overview for clarity:

Hardware Setup:
Components: Arduino Nano, 4x 2.2-inch flex sensors, MPU6050 IMU, 6-DOF robotic arm (with 6 servos), PCA9685 servo controller, Raspberry Pi 4, 5V power supply.
Connections:
Flex sensors: Connect to Arduino analog pins A0-A3 with 10kΩ resistors in a voltage divider configuration.
MPU6050: Connect to Arduino I2C pins (SDA: A4, SCL: A5, VCC: 3.3V, GND: GND).
PCA9685: Connect to Raspberry Pi I2C pins (SDA: GPIO 2, SCL: GPIO 3, VCC: 5V, GND: GND). Connect servos to PCA9685 channels 0-5.
Arduino to Raspberry Pi: Use USB cable for serial communication (/dev/ttyUSB0).
Safety: Ensure secure wiring and proper power supply (5V, high current for servos). Test servos individually to avoid overextension.
Software Setup:
Arduino:
Install Arduino IDE and libraries: Wire, Adafruit_MPU6050, ArduinoJson.
Upload Gesture_Glove.ino to the Arduino Nano.
Raspberry Pi:
Install Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit).
Install Python libraries: pyserial, adafruit-circuitpython-servokit, numpy.
Save Gesture_Control.py and Calibrate_Sensors.py on the Raspberry Pi.
Calibration: Run Calibrate_Sensors.py first to generate calibration.json, then update Gesture_Glove.ino with calibration values (or load them dynamically in Gesture_Control.py).
Calibration:
Run Calibrate_Sensors.py with the glove worn, following prompts to straighten and bend fingers.
Verify calibration data in calibration.json and update FLEX_MIN and FLEX_MAX in Gesture_Glove.ino if needed.
Test IMU offsets by holding the glove in a neutral position and checking for near-zero values after offset correction.
Testing and Calibration:
Arduino: Use Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to verify JSON output from Gesture_Glove.ino.
Raspberry Pi: Test serial communication with minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200.
Arm Control: Test Gesture_Control.py with simple gestures (e.g., open/close hand, tilt wrist) and verify arm movement.
Calibrate servo angles and kinematic parameters (L1, L2, L3) based on your arm’s geometry.
Deployment and Optimization:
Deploy the system for pick-and-place tasks (e.g., moving a small object).
Optimize control loop for low latency (<100 ms) by adjusting delay in both scripts.
Add error handling for serial disconnections and invalid sensor data.
Secure the glove and arm components to prevent mechanical stress.
Documentation for Website:
Create a GitHub repository with all code files, a README, and a block diagram (use Lucidchart or Draw.io).
Record a demo video showing gesture control and pick-and-place tasks (use OBS Studio).
Host the code and video on your website, linking to the GitHub repository.
Notes
Robotic Arm: The inverse kinematics is simplified for 3-DOF positioning. For a full 6-DOF arm, extend the inverse_kinematics function with additional joints and orientation control [].
Gesture Mapping: The current mapping uses average flex angles for gripper control and IMU acceleration for position. Enhance with machine learning (e.g., KNN classifier) for complex gestures [].
Power Management: Use a high-current 5V supply for servos to avoid brownouts.
Safety: Ensure the arm’s workspace is clear to prevent collisions during testing.
