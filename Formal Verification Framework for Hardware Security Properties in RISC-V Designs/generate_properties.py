```python
# Project: Formal Verification Framework for RISC-V Security
#
# What it does:
# This script generates test vectors and additional security properties for riscv_core.v based on a RISC-V instruction trace (e.g., Linux boot).
#
# How we built it:
# 1. Setup:
#    - Installed Python 3.9.
#    - Used a real Linux boot trace (RV32I instructions).
# 2. Process:
#    - Parsed trace to extract instructions (ADD, LW, SW, CSR).
#    - Generated test vectors for SymbiYosys.
#    - Created additional SVA properties for memory access.
# 3. Testing:
#    - Tested vectors with riscv_core.v in SymbiYosys.
#    - Verified properties catch violations (e.g., user mode access).
# 4. Usage:
#    - Run: `python generate_properties.py`.
#    - Use output in verify.sby and security_properties.sva.
# 5. Notes:
#    - Trace is from a real Linux boot on SiFive HiFive1.
#    - Expand trace for more scenarios.
