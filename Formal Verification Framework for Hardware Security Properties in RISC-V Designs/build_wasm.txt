# What it does:
# This script compiles symbiyosys_wrapper.rs to WebAssembly for the dashboard.
#
# How we built it:
# 1. Setup:
#    - Installed Rust and wasm-pack.
#    - Created Cargo.toml for WASM project.
# 2. Usage:
#    - Run: `bash build_wasm.sh`.
#    - Outputs symbiyosys_wrapper.js and .wasm to project directory.
# 3. Notes:
#    - Ensure Rust and wasm-pack are installed.
#    - Run in the same directory as symbiyosys_wrapper.rs.

#!/bin/bash
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../ --out-name symbiyosys_wrapper
